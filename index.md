###Announcement

The Vanderbilt Commodore Orchestra is excited to welcome Professor Jeremy Wilson as our next Music Director. We could not have been happier with his decision to accept our invitation! We look forward to next fall when he will begin working with us.

We are the orchestra of the general community at Vanderbilt. We exist to give you a place to share the music you love.

If you're interested in joining, we would love to have you.

**We love music:** We enjoy and embrace all kinds of music in Music City USA. However, our focus is on creating classical music.


**We are diverse:** We consist of everyone from alumni and administrators to undergraduates in their first year from all over the world. Go 'Dores!

**We are more than just an orchestra:** We do our best to entertain each other with more than music. We always strive to become a closer-knit community with events and outings unrelated to music.

**Music heals:** We believe that we can make people's lives a better one by doing our best at making music. We believe that music can heal both the performer and the listener.
