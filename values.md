###Our Mission
The purpose of the VCO is to provide totally-inclusive, musically enjoyable, educational, and culturally enriching performance opportunities for all members of the Vanderbilt University community while delivering high–quality music to the Vanderbilt University community and beyond.

###Our Beliefs and Commitments
The VCO believes that music is essential and extremely important to the well–being of both the individual and the society at large. In addition, we believe that it is beneficial for everyone to participate in a musical experience at a meaningful level either as the performer or the listener.

The VCO is committed to remaining an organization which encourages a non-competitive atmosphere. The VCO will welcome anyone from the Vanderbilt community to participate and will never exclude or discriminate against anyone from the Vanderbilt community for race, gender, sexual orientation, disability, age, or musical skill level.

It is our belief that anyone should be able to participate, even if he or she will be learning an instrument for the first time. We will welcome them and do our best to ensure a musically enriching experience.
